-- Hyperparameter Tuning
explore larger embedded spaces e.g. 400 nodes
consider attention layer
experiment with non-linearities. Lots of projects use torch.tanh
experiment with non-average pooling mechanisms
add cnn encoder
try zero weights initially

-- Morphology
Build a lemmatizer
These take a word and a tag (the form of the word) then predict the morphological variants

-- Misc
